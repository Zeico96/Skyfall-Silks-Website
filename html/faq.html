            <h1 class="heading">Frequently asked questions (FAQ)</h1>

            <h4 class="tiny-heading">How much space so you need to set up the portable rig?</h4>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>
                    The rig is 7.5x7.5x7.5m in a triangle, but I need some space to set up, generally 9 square metres of flat 
                    ground is sufficient.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4 class="tiny-heading">Have you got a smaller set up?</h4>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>
                    Yes, we can set up a 4.5m tripod, needing 6m square. It's also only 4.5m high. That makes it easier to fit undercover at time too.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4 class="tiny-heading">Do you have insurance?</h4>
            <div class="answer">

                    Yes, with your quote we supply you with a copy of our insurance.
                </p>
            </div>

                    Yes, we normally warm our muscles up with hula hoops, learning a skill at the same time.

                </p>
            </div>

            <h4 class="tiny-heading">Do I need any previous experience? Or gymnastic background?</h4>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>
                    No, no experience necessary at all, any level can do something. You'll get experience and strength as you go, and surprise yourself 
                    what you can do, in a short amount of time.
                </p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>
                    I've had 2 year old siblings, they normally just join their siblings for a short while. Some 4-5 year olds enjoy it, but generally 6 is a good age.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4 class="tiny-heading">Do you work towards competitions? </h4>
